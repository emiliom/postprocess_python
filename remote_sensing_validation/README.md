**01_preparing_geotiffs**

This folder contains the workflow to start with gdat output from SnowModel and ends with aligned and resampled geotiffs that perfectly align with the remote sensing product.

**02_generate_stats** 

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that will access the RS and SnowModel output and generate spatial statistics and figures organized in a directory system.
