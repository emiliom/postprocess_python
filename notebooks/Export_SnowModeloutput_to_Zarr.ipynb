But instead of first writing to incremental netcdf files, it's more practical to read the binary data in the same time segments, and write to zarr instead, concatenating along the time dimension\n",

See [xarray #1598](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/1598) and [this](https://cf-trac.llnl.gov/trac/ticket/52) for background discussions. CF/netCDF don't forbid NaN as `_FillValue`. [NCEI NetCDF Template discourages it](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/data/formats/netcdf/v2.0/faq.html).\n",
